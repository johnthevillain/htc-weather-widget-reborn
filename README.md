# HTC Weather Widget Reborn!

This is one of my first projects. <br>
HTC Weather Widget Reborn is a HTML weather weather that allows you to have a great-looking weather widget on your device. Based on the HTC Animated Weather - iPhone 6 from Cydia, it emulates the weather widget on HTC smartphones and displays the clock, weather animations, current conditions (humidity, temperature, ect..), and the forecast. It works on Xen HTML for jailbroken iOS devices and any other software that supports HTML widgets.

The weather data is from Weatherbit.

Enjoy the weather!

### Installation

**You need a Weatherbit API Key for this widget to work!** <br>
Since weather data sources like Yahoo and the Weather Channel ended offering weather data to the public without login, you need to create an account on Weatherbit and get a free API key. Get the free one, that is all you ever need.

For XenHTML
1. Download the widget (the folder "HTC Weather Widget (Weatherbit)" and its contents) and put it in your devices' Library/iWidgets folder.
2. Edit the Widget.html file and insert your API key between the quotes in the line below: <br>
`var apiKey = "YOUR API KEY GOES HERE BETWEEN THESE QUOTES. TO GET A FREE API KEY, CREATE A FREE ACCOUNT ON WEATHERBIT.";`
2. In Xen HTML, add the widget to your home/lock screen.
3. Enjoy!

### Settings

<br>
You could
* Change the style of the widget (show clock, weather forecast, show just the clock, show just the forecast, ect.)
* Disable/enable weather conditions
* Use the metric system (if you are tired of the complicated American pounds, miles, and Fahrenheit)
* Show RealFeel temperatures instead of the acutal temperatures (for both current temperature and forecast temperatures)
* Change the weather location (enter a Latitude, Longitude or Postal/ZIP Code)
* Resize it if needed
* Update interval

Please remember that this is one of my projects so if there are any glitches, please let me know!
